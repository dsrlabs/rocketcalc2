# rocket-maxv-peakalt Version 1
# This program calculates the maximum (peak) altitude and velocity of a single stage
# low power model rocket, at engine burnout.
# User entered data is used for the calculation. 
# Future versions will parse data from a csv file.
# Note: Rocket engine thrust data can vary by +/- 10%
